### Motivations

The truth is that I am not satisfied doing the repetitive work of bookkeeping, nor do I want to go back to nonprofit management. My heart lies in more creative endeavors. Unfortunately, my great calling is writing and it is not a lucrative field to be in, in a time when I need to be able to financially support my family. So, I have come to development because it is both technical and creative, it requires ongoing learning, and will hopefully lead to a job that lets be support my family and still write on the on the side.
