### World Cup 2010

My husband and I were lucky enough to spend a month in South Africa in 2010. We went for the World Cup--the first time the Cup was ever held in Africa. It was an incredible experience. We got to see my favorite team, Argentina, lose spectacularly in the quarter final and watch tons of games in the streets with fans from all over the world.
